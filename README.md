# ClosuresKit
A Swift version of BlocksKit, namely, ClosuresKit, from a BlocksKit addict.

# Motivation
BlocksKit is a well known 3rd-party in iOS developing. As a BlocksKit addict, I show my greatest respect to it.
However, when I was turning into Swift, I found BlocksKit is not supporting a Swift version. Reasons are claimed in Issue263 (<https://github.com/zwaldowski/BlocksKit/issues/263>) of BlocksKit, but I assume that there are some other important reasons :) Anyway, if you are somehow a BlocksKit addict but using Swift now, please try this one. Suggestions are welcomed while I will try my best to improve this step by step.

# Installation
As I haven't submit the code to CocoaPod Specs repo yet, the current way to use the codes are as follow.

```
pod 'ClosuresKit', :git => 'https://github.com/hyichao/ClosuresKit.git'
```
